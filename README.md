# Parsing-an-XML-file
To parse an xml file using Python, we can use the xml module. This code uses the xml.etree.ElementTree library to parse the XML file and extract the data you need. It then prints the data for each book in the file. This code the uses openpyxl module to creates a new excel file and write the data to it in the table format.
